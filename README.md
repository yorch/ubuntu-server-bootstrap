# Simple Server Setup

A very simple script to setup base Ubuntu 14+ server environment with:

- Docker CE
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
- ZSH with [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
- Symlinks `python3` to `python` if `python` command is not found
- Tools:
  - `curl`
  - `git`
  - `htop`: Better `top`
  - `neovim`
  - `tig`: CLI git client
  - `vim`
  - `wget`
  - [SpeedTest CLI](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli)

## Installation

Just need to run:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorch/server-simple-setup/main/server-setup.sh | bash
# Or with `curl` if already installed:
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yorch/server-simple-setup/main/server-setup.sh | bash
```

This will take a few minutes, after its done, you might want to restart the box in case there is a newer kernel installed that just got installed.

At the minimum, you should log out and log in again so `zsh` gets activated on your session.
